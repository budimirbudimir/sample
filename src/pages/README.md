Adding /pages folder in order to be able to distinguish components higher and lower in the tree easily.
Also, after refactoring existing components, there may be a possibility to separate 'container/stateful' components from bare presentational/stateless components.
Not particularly sure how much it will affect performance, but may be cleaner to navigate.
